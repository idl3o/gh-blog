# Web3 Crypto Streaming Service Project

This project showcases a decentralized content streaming platform built on blockchain technology. It demonstrates how web3 technologies can revolutionize digital content distribution by addressing fundamental issues in traditional streaming services.

## Key Features

- **Creator-First Economics**: Enabling creators to receive 90%+ of generated revenue
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Transparent payments and content rights management using blockchain
- **Privacy Preservation**: Minimal data collection with user-controlled information
- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized content registry to prevent arbitrary content removal
- **Global Accessibility**: Worldwide content access through decentralized nodes
- **Instant Payments**: Near-immediate settlement without lengthy holding periods

## Technical Foundation

The platform leverages:

- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum and Polygon-based smart contracts for subscriptions and payments
- **Token Economy**: STREAM utility token for governance, incentives, and reduced fees
- **Content Addressing**: IPFS-based storage for resilient metadata management
- **Delivery Layer**: P2P streaming technology with decentralized CDN

## Explore the Project

Browse through the site to learn more about the platform's whitepaper, technology overview, and creator guides. This GitHub Pages implementation serves as both a project showcase and an educational resource for decentralized applications.
