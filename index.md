## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What cryptocurrencies are supported for payments?</strong></summary>
  <p>Our native STREAM token provides the best experience with lowest fees, but we also support ETH, MATIC, USDC, and DAI for payments. More tokens will be added based on community demand.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do creators get paid?</strong></summary>
  <p>Creators receive payments directly to their wallet addresses as subscriptions or tips occur, with only a minimal platform fee deducted. Payments are typically settled within minutes, not days or weeks.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is my content protected from piracy?</strong></summary>
  <p>We employ a multi-layered DRM approach combined with blockchain-verified watermarking to protect creator content while maintaining the benefits of decentralization.</p>
